#In the act phase, the agent will try one action in the environment. 
#If the action fails, the agent will not have executed the action in the world, and the agent will go to the next cycle.
#If the action succeeds, the action rules (this file) are evaluated using inference on the union of the action rules, the beliefs and the desires.
#This is how possible postconditions are triggered. Note that you cannot form new intentions in this phase, so, world actions cannot be postconditions of actions!!!
#Add your action postcondition rules below:

grab(X,K)>-keylocation(X,K) & +haskey(K) & ~grab(X,K)

open(X,K)>-nexttolock(X,K) & ~open(X,K)

goto(X,Y)>-location(X) & +location(Y) & ~location(Y)

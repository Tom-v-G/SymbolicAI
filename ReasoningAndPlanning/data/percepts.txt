#Every cycle at the sense step, the world generates percepts and returns to the agent a knowlegde base called the percept base.
#After this, inference is done on the union of the percept rules (this file), the agent's beliefs and the percept base.
#Every cycle your percept base changes, reflecting the current state the agent is in. 
#If you want to remember things from previous percepts, you have to build rules to do so.
#This is the purpose of the percept rules.
#Such rules typically add or delete beliefs, this is done with + and - operators.
#Add your percept rules below:

at(X)>+location(X) & +visited(X)

at(X)&passage(Y)>+link(X,Y)

at(X)&key(K)>+keylocation(X,K)

at(X)&locked(K)>+nexttolock(X,K)
